		<h3 id="abstract" class="page-header">Abstract</h3>
		<p class="text-justify">Background:
			Refactoring is a common software maintenance practice. While the literature defines standard code
			modifications for each popular refactoring type, popular IDEs provide refactoring tools aiming to support
			these standard modifications. Previous studies indicated that developers either frequently avoid using these
			tools or end up modifying and even reversing the code automatically refactored by the IDE. This means that
			developers are forced to manually apply refactorings partially or completely, which is cumbersome and
			error-prone. All these factors indicate that refactoring support may not be entirely aligned with certain
			refactoring activity needs. Thus, the improvement of tooling support for refactoring in practice requires
			the understanding in what ways developers tailor refactoring modifications in their produced code. To
			address this issue, we conduct an analysis of 1,162 refactorings composed of more than 100k program
			modifications from 13 software projects. Our results reveal that developers recurrently apply patterns of
			additional modifications along with the standard ones in their refactorings, from here on called patterns of
			customized refactorings. For instance, we found customized refactorings in 80.77% of the
			Move Method instances observed in software projects. We also investigated the features of
			refactoring tools in popular IDEs and observed that very common customization patterns are not fully
			supported by them. Additionally, to understand the relevance of these customizations, we conducted a survey
			with 40 developers about the most frequent customization patterns we found. Developers confirm they
			commonly apply those patterns in their projects and agree that improvements in IDE's refactoring support is
			needed. These observations also suggest refactoring guidelines must be updated to reflect typical
			refactoring customizations. The update of these guidelines can better help IDE builders to improve
			customized refactoring support. We revealed a range of refactoring customization patterns for four very
			popular refactoring types, which shed light on the improvement of existing refactoring guidelines and tool
			support.

		<h3 id="modifications" class="page-header">Refactoring-related modifications</h3>

		A code modification is part of the set of modifications of a refactoring operation identified by a refactoring detection tool. A refactoring operation also may contain additional modifications that interact with the source/target methods (Table 1). 
		
		By a manual analysis of the refactoring operations, we make decisions about how to decide if an additional modification is (not) part of a refactoring operation, which we describe as follows. First, we created filters to automatically identify and avoid questionable instances of refactorings. For instance, the filters avoided instances of refactorings where the source/target methods had parameters using diamond operators or the operator "...", once these operators allow the method to have any number of parameters, we are not able to detect the interaction with source/target methods correctly based on the method signature.
		For modifications occurring within a source/target of an operation, we identified recurring forms of non-refactoring modifications (for each refactoring type), ignoring these modifications. We also double-checked whether any of these modifications was incorrectly classified as a non-refactoring modification. 

		For each external modification interacting with a source/target, we found out two cases of additional refactoring modifications: (1) external modifications that were clearly part of the refactoring operation and had nothing to do with a non-refactoring change, and (2) external modifications that we considered simultaneously pertaining to both the refactoring operation and another non-refactoring change, such as a feature addition. For the cases in (2), those modifications were part of the refactoring operation (even though they were also motivated by a feature change, L.805) as they only existed due to the structural alteration aimed by the refactoring. These modifications in (2) are those that typically determine “the interface” between the refactoring operation and other co-occurring (non-refactoring) changes. In fact, existing IDEs consider these “refactoring interfaces” as part of the refactoring operation as they already provide some preliminary support to customize these “interfaces”.  For instance, existing IDEs support developers in customizing an Extract Method refactoring by enabling them to qualify a method as public, protected or private (which is not a standard modification in the Extract Method definition) to bind the refactoring modifications with the non-refactoring modifications. This binding is made only due to the refactoring operation (and, therefore, is part of it) as a new method creation is an intrinsic goal of the refactoring. Making the method accessible (to external non-refactoring changes) is a compulsory modification to introduce method calls from client methods that compose the most frequent customizations. Finally, there were cases of refactoring customizations that excluded standard modifications from the literature that we either detected by manual analysis or depended on additional information in the software project repository.

		<h3 id="applicability" class="page-header">Applicability</h3>

		<div class="text-justify">
			Our study complements previous studies[8][14] and helps the development of refactoring tools well
			aligned with refactorings in practice. Tool developers can use these catalogs to create flexible tools,
			allowing developers to apply the patterns as a configuration of the tool or through recommendations.
			For instance, the following image illustrates an additional configuration for Netbeans.
			This new configuration should allow developers to handle the client methods that will be
			affected by the refactoring, especially, to handle the modification *Method Access* that
			composes the most frequent patterns. In this way, developers should be able to decide how each client method
			should be affected.
		</div>
		<img src="images/config.png" alt="" style="margin-top: 18px; margin-bottom: 18px;">

		<div>For more complex patterns, composed of several modifications,
			refactoring tools should allow developers to create their own
			customization in a step-wise way, adding or removing code modifications
			that compose each refactoring. Finally, these tools could also recommend
			customized refactorings for each developer.
		</div>


		<h3 id="threats" class="page-header">Threats to validity</h3>

		<p class="text-justify">

		<h5 style="margin-bottom: 12px; font-size: 18px;"> Internal Validity</h5>

		a) RMiner may yield false positives and false negatives. It has an effectiveness of 87.2% for recall and 98%
		for precision, which is the best effectiveness among refactoring detection tools. To alleviate this threat,
		we manually inspected some instances identified by it during our analysis. Also, the newest versions of RMiner
		improved mainly the recall value, which would not change the results since the number of false positives
		(precision) is still similar in both versions.
		<br>
		<br>
		b) Due to the practical need for floss refactoring, custom refactorings cannot be limited only to changes
		that preserve the behavior. Otherwise, we would disregard common goals for developers such as making the code
		more robust and fixing bugs that may often require the same additional code changes. Finally, customized
		refactorings include only recurrent refactoring’s co-occurring changes that satisfy some
		criteria. These changes should be semantically involved in the refactoring operation
		and interact with the source or target methods. These criteria ensure a link between the
		addressed code change and the standard changes of the refactoring. In some instances,
		these changes were mentioned as critical for developers to achieve their goals.

		<br>
		<br>
		<h5 style="margin-bottom: 12px; font-size: 18px;">Construct Validity</h5>

		a) The RMiner detects 15 types of refactorings in version
		1.0, but we are considering only four types of refactorings. Although these four
		refactorings may not fully embrace all forms of refactoring customizations, these four refactorings have
		been frequently applied by developers in practice. Also, these
		refactorings affect the program structure differently at method-level and class-level. For instance,
		Extract Method is a method-level refactoring, affecting directly especially one class. Different
		from Extract Method, Move Methods, and Pull Up Methods affect at least two classes,
		including changes affecting a class hierarchy. Yet, these refactorings have similarities with other
		refactoring types, e.g. Move Method moves a method from one class to another, similarly to Push
		Downs and Pull ups. We chose Pull Up to understand this method movement in the context
		of a class hierarchy. We avoid textual refactorings such as renames. Given their simpler and
		lexical nature, they have less room for structural customization. Also, any customization
		exclusively from interleaved refactorings, such as Move and any other refactoring, would be
		an addition to the customizations already present in our study and it does not affect our
		results. Finally, the selected refactorings have (i) often a larger scope and a higher number of
		customizations, and (ii) a much stronger relation to major design problems.
		<br>
		<br>

		b) Although we are currently analyzing refactorings detected only by RMiner, it is possible
		to observe that RMiner's detection rules include several statements which demonstrated to allow the
		detection of a variety of refactorings instances, which can include possible customizations.

		<br>
		<br>
		c) The collected modification types may not consider all possible modification types. We used Eclipse's JDT
		library, once this library has a very low level of granularity. In this way, we can detect a large number of
		modifications. Besides, this library is commonly used to build automated refactoring tools for Eclipse
		and RMiner.


		<br>
		<br>
		<h5 style="margin-bottom: 12px; font-size: 18px;">External Validity</h5>

		We performed an in-depth analysis of refactoring instances from 13 Java
		projects, which satisfy somep predefined criteria. Our results might not
		necessarily hold to other projects involving other primary programming languages and/or from domains not
		covered by our dataset. Moreover, we focused our analysis on open-source software projects. The nature of
		refactoring in closed-source software projects is not necessarily the same as refactoring in open-source
		software projects. However, popular open-source projects have a major concern with software modularity
		tending to continuously refactor the source code. Finally, we analyzed projects with differing sizes/domains
		and all key findings were uniform. The domains are: database management, libraries
		to streaming systems, and libraries to social media. These projects have a viral
		growth behavior and an active community, according to Github metrics. All projects are detailed on
		this website and will be updated as necessary
